
1. Provided there are environment variables $WHICH_ENV, $VERSION_SNAPSHOT. 
2. You can find the "target" folder (with the name "$WHICH_ENV") at the same directory level of the current Jenkinsfile
3. The target folder contains a list of YAML files which each represent a information of a host machine. We called them Host YAML
4. Each Host YAML file contains "host_components" (artifacts) like below:

    host: 127.0.0.1
    hostname: xxxxxx
    host_credential: aaaa
    host_groups:
    - APP
    - DIT1
    props:
    e: 1
    f: 2
    host_components:
    - name: component1
    props:
        a: 1
        b: 2
    - name: component2
    props:
        c: 1
        d: 2

4. The $VERSION_SNAPSHOT is the web url which can retrieve a YAML file which is an array of items with attributes (name, artifact_path, version)
5. The stages of Jenkinsfile includes:
   - loop through all artifacts declared in the "snapshot" YAML file
   - there is a nested-loop that loop all Host YAML in the target folder
   - for each Host YAML, if it contains the artifact, then echo found message


    # loop the component in the snapshot
    # loop each host, find the component

        #if the component exists for that host
            # generate the values.yaml for that component on that host
            # aggregate the by groups props + host props + component props

            # get credential of hosts, ssh hosts
            # deploy the artifact to that host
            # deploy the scripts + values.yaml to that host
